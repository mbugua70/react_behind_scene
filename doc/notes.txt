// HOW DOES REACT UPDATE THE DOM //
-- How function component are exercuted.
--- NB // When a state changes the component will be exercuted again.
-- memo function is a built in react function that is used to prevent normal function exercusion.
-- memo will compare the props values and if the props values are the same the function wont exercute.
-- Dont overuse the memo function- - place it on the high up the component in the component tree.
-- blocking the exercusion of the high end componet will also block the exercusion of the child components

//useCallback hook //
-- can be used to avoid the recreation of the function.
